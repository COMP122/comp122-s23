## Grade guesstimator
This tool provides a guesstimate of your final grade--based upon a number of assumptions.
Such assumptions may not come to fluition!  Hence, this tool can only be used to provide 
the student with an guesstimate of what their final grade _might_ be.

#### Installation

1. Install an appropriate program to display a Mardown file.
   - For example, One Markdown: https://apps.apple.com/us/app/one-markdown/id1507139439
   - You can view the output file via a text editor, but the alignment of values within a table may be off.

1. If you have followed the directions to setup your COMP122 filesystem, then execute the following steps:
   - `cd /Users/steve/classes/comp122`
   - `cp etc/grade_guesstimator.defaults deliverables/grade_guesstimator.defaults`

#### Setup

1. Edit the file /Users/steve/classes/comp122/deliverables/grade_guesstimator.defaults, as appropriate
1. Ensure you do a `git pull` on each of your individual deliverables


#### Execution

1. If you have followed the directions to setup your COMP122 filesystem, and befored the installation step, then execute the following commands.

   `cd classes/comp122/deliverables`
   `grade_guesstimator`

1. You may edit the values within the file grade_guesstimator.defaults to obtain a better guesstimate of your grade.
