## Review from Last-time:

  1. Combinational Circuits
     1. combining the three primary gates to form more interesting functions
        - XOR
        - Full Adder
        - 4-bit:
          * Full Adder
          * Using Subraction via Complements --> Full Subtractor
          * And, Or, Nor, etc...
     1. Use of Full Adder to review
        - Sum of Products
        - Algebric Transformations
     1. BCD: Binary Coded Decimal
        - Yet another way to encode Decimal numbers
        - BCD Addition
          - Tie back to design tradeoff: RISC versus CISC
