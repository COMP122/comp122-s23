   1. "Introduction to Numbering Systems"

## Questions from Last Lecture/Lab, etc.:
   * M/W @ 9:00 am: 
     - When is the next quiz/exam?
     - In 21-encoding, encoding binary to binary -- yes, just copy?
   * M/W @ 2:00 pm: 
     - none
   * T/R @ 9:00 am:
     - Is there a way to automate pulling a number of repos?  Yes, check your comp122/bin/directory

     - What due we do if we don't have enough digits when we convert
       - a whole number?  add extra zeros to the left side of the number
